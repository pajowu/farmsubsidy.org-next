The aim of farmsubsidy.org is to obtain detailed data relating to payments and
recipients of farm subsidies in every EU member state and make this data
available in a way that is useful to European citizens. Farmsubsidy.org is run
by [FragDenStaat](https://fragdenstaat.de), the central contact for all
questions relating to freedom of information in Germany.

### What are EU farm subsidies?

Farm subsidies are EU payments to public authorities, companies and farmers who
are active in the agricultural sector and/or contribute to its maintenance.
Subsidies are financed by taxpayers' money, primarily through the EU, but the
Member States also contribute financially in a direct way. Subsidies are part
of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which came into force in 1962.

### Where does the data come from?

All the data presented on this website has either been published directly by EU
country governments, or obtained from them by freedom of information requests.

Please note that our numbers only summarise the contents of our database and
are *not* official statistics. Plus, due to legal reasons, not all data is
public on this platform.

**Because of this limitations and different levels of data quality, official
numbers published by governments or in media stories might (slightly) differ
from what you find on this website and are most likely a bit higher.**

It's general a good idea to consider our numbers and aggregations as *minimum*
values.
